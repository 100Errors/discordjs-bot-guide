#Coding a Music Bot

Everyone including their grandparents want to create a music bot, I myself have created a music bot and believe me it's not as easy as you would think.

However, if you insist on creating a music bot, if you support me on patreon for $5, you will get a series of step by step video tutorials from start to finish, and access to the completed source code to a custom music bot (When the series concludes).

As well as the music bot tutorial you also get a `patron` role on my guild, a private patron only channel to discuss with other patrons, priority d.js bot help, behind the scenes pictures, videos and vlogs, and early access to regular content and future patron only tutorial series.
