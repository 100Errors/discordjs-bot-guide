# Discord.js Getting Started

I'm taking this guide over from 〈evie.codes〉, as she has decided to focus on her own library \(Dithcord\), but I want to take a moment to thank Evie for everything she's done for the community. Now a lot of people's personal opinions will differ from mine, due to various levels of information that's out there.

But to me Evie is a mentor, she was the one that metaphorically took me under her wing and encouraged me to learn new things and to challenge myself, and hey I've got a decently popular YouTube series because of her, she played a major role in my decision to create a series, so please take a moment and think about how many people Evie has helped with this guide.

And I am honoured to be continuing it.

## Introduction

She decided to write this guide because it became obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be quite daunting for newcomers. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on the support channels.

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, She figured a guide would be a great place to start!
